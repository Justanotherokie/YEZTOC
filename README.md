# YJAOEZTOC
Simpler SAP / ABAP Migration / Transport of Copies utility.
This app makes working with TOC's and Transports less error prone.

It also makes it easier to build / merge task objects into TOC's

Change your Target System/Client and you're ready to go.

There are a lot of other Classes for the ALV / Generics but they
are all rolled into a single ABAP Source file so you can get going
quicker.

You may split it out into separate Includes/Objects as you see fit.

You will need to add your own screen 100.  See the Screen shot .png's.

I like to use the Two transaction approach to avoid the selection screen
on startup.  I shouldn't have had to do this but as ABAP reaches it's
sunset little things start breaking so I had to use the Two Transaction
approach because I couldn't find a way to make it do what I wanted.
